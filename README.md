about teams, players, and games from European football. The dataset focuses on the top five
European leagues for the 2014-2020 seasons which includes Premier League of England,
Serie A of Italy, Bundesliga of Germany, La Liga of Spain, and Ligue 1
of France. The data is organized as a relational model as it
provides an ideal structure for the chosen dataset given the amount of
interactions and relationships among teams, players, and managers over time.
