\subsection{Hosting Database on a Cloud Server}
Once the soccer data has been preprocessed into a set of tables in *.csv format, the database will be created and hosted on a cloud-based platform. For the purpose of our project, Heroku platform was chosen to host our soccer database, and potentially, a web UI for viewing and adding data.
Based on its documentation, \begin{quote}
    'Heroku is a platform as a service based on a managed container system, with integrated data services and a powerful ecosystem, for deploying and running modern apps.' \cite{b10}
\end{quote} Basically, a Heroku app server is the center element of a web-hosted project, with additional on-demand services such as data services, continuous integration, and security services attached to the app. In our case, we are using a Heroku app with Heroku Postgresql attached. The following steps describe  the process to successfully hosting the soccer database on the Heroku platform.

%- Brief introduction and Installing Heroku
%    -Heroku Cli
%    -Heroku Postgresql
%- Adding tables to the database using the heroku postgres cli
\subsection{Using The Database}
- Connecting to PG Admin 
- Querying data and export
    - use sample query as an example
