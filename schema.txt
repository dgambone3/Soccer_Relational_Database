TODO: data aggregation:
    add venues
        look up team names on wikipedia, 
        find home stadium/facility (not field)
        use current venue
Questions:
Do join tables with attributes count as our 10 tables?
AppearIn join table: is this sensible violation of BCNF, or should we rewrite
            super key but functional dependency
            justification: redundant results for simpler accessing/aggregation
            violation: home result implies away result
In ER diagram, what is conventional way to show attribute is foreign, do we need to show foreign attributes in ER diagram?
